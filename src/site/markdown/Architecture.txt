Everything is grouped around the _connector repository_ containing all informations about the configured data bases.

- Data base specific informations are contained in [Configurations](Configuration.html)
- [Hints](Hints.html) may influence the migration process in various ways. E.g., by filtering the list of tables to be copied.
- [Tools](Tools.html) use the connector repository and the hints to do their work
